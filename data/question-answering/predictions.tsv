What is the effect of childhood tuberculosis in childhood pneumonia?	A recent systematic review of tuberculosis as a comorbidity of childhood pneumonia reported culture-confirmed disease in about 8% of cases [50] .

What are the risk factors in childhood pneumonia?	 incomplete or inadequate vaccination must be considered as a major preventable risk factor for childhood pneumonia.
